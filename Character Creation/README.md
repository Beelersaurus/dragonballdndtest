# Character Creation

Where do you fit into this vast, mystical world? Perhaps you are a brilliant scientist exploring the world in search of an ancient secret? Or you run a gang of your own, stalking the wastes for worthy foes. Or you may be a recruit for the time patrol, hunting down villains who have broken the temporal law. Or you live a simple life, tending to your farm in the distant lands. Whatever adventure you find yourself on, consider how this world affects your character, and dream of how your character can affect this world.
